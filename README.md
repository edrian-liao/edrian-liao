### 👋 Kumusta - _how are you_? 
# I'm Edrian Liao
🎓 I'm pursuing __electrical engineering__ and __computer science__ with a concentration in _machine learning and artificial intelligence_ and _a minor in mathematics_ at __Duke University '25__

👀 I'm interested in leveraging technology in attaining the sustainable development goals with an intended focus on climate action and quality education.

🌐 This past summer I worked with the __Duke Energy Analytics Lab__ through the Climate+ summer program preparing a __global dataset of 10M images__ pulled from _Landsat, NAIP, and Sentinel_ through the Google Earth Engine. Here's an [overview](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/tracking-climate-change-causes-impacts-with-satellites-and-ai/) of what we did.

🌱 Last Dec 2022,  I built a website for an non-profit organization in the Philippines that focuses on providing financial literacy to Filipino high school students.

💞️ This summer, I will embark on a project based in the countryside of the Philippines _(more details in June)_.
