### 👋 Kumusta - _how are you_? 
# I'm Edrian Liao
🎓 I'm pursuing a double major in __electrical and computer engineering__ and __computer science__ with a concentration in _machine learning and artificial intelligence_ and _a minor in mathematics_ at __Duke University '25__

👀 I'm interested in leveraging technology in attaining the sustainable development goals with an intended focus on climate action and quality education.

🌐 This past summer I worked with the __Duke Energy Analytics Lab__ through the Climate+ summer program preparing a __global dataset of 10M images__ pulled from _Landsat, NAIP, and Sentinel_ through the Google Earth Engine. Here's an [overview](https://bigdata.duke.edu/projects/tracking-climate-change-causes-impacts-with-satellites-and-ai/) of what we did.

🌱 Last Dec 2022,  I built a [website](https://edrian-liao.github.io/project-kayamanan-website/index.html) for an non-profit organization in the Philippines that focuses on providing financial literacy to Filipino high school students.

💞️ This summer, I started my project named __PlanetTales__ that aims to share stories about the impacts of climate change to the most remote and vulnerable areas of the world, stories not only shared with words but also images, videos, and data to encapsulate and give justice to people’s experiences. Funded by my scholarship, my project's first stop is my hometown in the Philippines.
